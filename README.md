# Overview
The challenge it self is kinda harsh for a beginner at first moment. But after thinking about that: that's the point of the challenge! so i decided to make it anyway. The HTML's structure is very clear right afte you see the preview, some divs, some navigation, buttons, links, fundamental knowlege. On the other hand, the CSS base has to be solid to do it, i personally had headeache to set all the layout perfect as possible. As i said, i'm proud that i did.
